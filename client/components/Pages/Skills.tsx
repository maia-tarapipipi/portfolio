            Problem Solver: My work in my previous industry as production
            assistant has set me up well to problem solve. Often in the creative
            process, you need creative solutions.

            Quick Learner: In my previous work it was expected that I would
            learn on the job and this has taught me how to learn new ideas and
            techniques quickly and apply them. The dev academy bootcamp really
            put this skill to the test and I learned that i found joy in the
            process.

            Empathetic: As a MƒÅori woman, I come from a diverse background. This
            diversity has helped me become more empathetic to others
            perspectives and helped me connect with different walks of life.
