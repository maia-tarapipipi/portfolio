            Adaptable and Resourceful: As a production assistant in my previous
            industry, I honed my skills in problem-solving and adaptability. The
            creative process often requires thinking outside the box and finding
            innovative solutions to challenges that arise. I have become adept
            at navigating various situations, identifying opportunities, and
            quickly adapting to new circumstances.

            Continuous Learner: Throughout my career, I have embraced a growth
            mindset, always eager to learn and expand my knowledge. In my
            previous role, I thrived on learning new ideas and techniques on the
            job, and this drive for continuous improvement carried over to the
            Dev Academy bootcamp. Embracing the learning journey, I discovered a
            genuine joy in acquiring new skills and knowledge, which fuels my
            passion for development and fuels my motivation to keep evolving as
            a professional.

            Empathy and Cultural Understanding: As a MƒÅori woman, I bring a rich
            and diverse background to my work. This unique perspective has
            nurtured my sense of empathy, enabling me to better understand and
            connect with people from various walks of life. Embracing different
            viewpoints and cultural nuances is an integral part of who I am, and
            it enhances my ability to build meaningful relationships and
            collaborate effectively with others.
