        What is more appealing than keeping your friends, family, loved ones or
        enemies accountable with the threat of social pressure?
      </p>
      <p>Well do we have the app for you!</p>
      <p>
        Welcome to Pinky Promise! The brain child of 5 talented Dev Academy
        graduates which aim to help people make and keep promises between each
        other. Worked on in a 10 day period as a final group project our aim was
        to create an app which a user can:
        <ul>
          <li>log into using Auth-0 securely,</li>
          <li>profile with your name, username, and bio,</li>
          <li>add a friend,</li>
          <li>
            to make a promise with this friend which both users can see which
            has a name, description and date
          </li>
          <li>
            to then either choose to keep this promise or to break this promise
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
          below is a comprehensive wireframe which we created during our
          planning stage
